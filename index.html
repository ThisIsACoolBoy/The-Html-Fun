      <h2>Downloading with phones.</h2>
      <p>You would be thinking of getting that project onto your phone?
      Here is what you must do, so first go to your phone and find your file manager.
      Select download folder and you got it. Now open the HTMLPage1.html for real fun! And see the benifits of a cake and a pie.</p>
      <h2>Downloading with the tablet.</h2>
      <p>Tablets are very hard. It is very hard to find your downloads. Android is pretty easy though you just do the same thing like the phone. Lets go for iOS iPads. So go to google chrome. Then download it, when you download it, wait and you will see Open In, then click it and click save in files, click iCloud Drive and click Done. Then check your iCloud drive and you got it! HTML is compatible with chrome only. Sorta because CSS doesn't work and JavaScript.</p>
      <h2>Downloading with the COMPUTER or PRIMARY COMPUTER.</h2>
      <p>You shall follow the steps above. Then look for your Downloads folder. And tada! You got it! Whats next. Open HTMLPage1.html now you got it! Have fun with knowing the benifits of code,cake and pie!</p>
